## ☕ Coffee Counter README ☕

Coffee Counter is a extension for VSCode, which lets you keep track of the drinks you have while coding.
Please be vary this is my first TS Project and might include some bugs, which I will take care of in the future. To keep track of your consumption, a small drinks.json file will be created which should be located in your project root after the first startup of the extension. I recommend adding this to your version control system.
This Extension was coded to get more familiar with Typescript and modern JS Workflows.

## Features 

There is a small coffee mug symbol at the bottom bar of your vscode window. Left-clicking on there will increase your drink.
You can change your favorite drink in the vscode settings under CoffeeCounter.
If you need extra drinks implemented, just hit me up with a pull request.
